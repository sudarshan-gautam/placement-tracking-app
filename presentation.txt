SUDARSHAN (Full Stack Developer):
Thank you, Shail. For Practitioner Passport, we've implemented a modern tech stack designed for performance, scalability, and maintainability.

Our frontend is built with:
- Next.js 14.1.0 for server-side rendering and routing
- React 18.2.0 for component-based UI development
- TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- Recharts for data visualization
- Lucide React for consistent iconography

For authentication and state management, we've implemented:
- Context API for global state management
